## Notice
OREH has discontinued into Temple, which supports all versions 2007E  - 2013L. Due to OREH's discontinuation (and leaks of the DLLs), [we have released some OREH versions publicly](https://github.com/ZwDaNk/OREH/releases/tag/v1).

# OREH
The source and downloads for a discontinued exploit for the launcher "Only Retro R≈çblox Here".

## Key
